## Introduction <a name='introduction'></a>

<a href='https://www.austintexas.gov/austin-animal-center'>Austin Animal Center</a> provides animal services for the city of Austin, and unincorporated Travis county.  Since 2010 they have implemented a <a href='https://www.austintexas.gov/page/no-kill-plan'>'no-kill' strategy</a> to increase live outcomes for adoptions; this included community partnerships, community education, increased animal services and better data collection.  The goal of this project is to help understand how the Austin Animal Center can provide better services and outcomes for the animals and owners that they serve.
